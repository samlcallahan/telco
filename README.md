## Telco Churn Project

To run from your terminal, you must make an env.py file that contains your username, hostname, and password for your SQL server.

In addition, you must specify your random state seed there. I used 43.

Please use these variable names: user, host, password, seed.

After that, all you have to do is run "python predict.py" in your terminal. 

A csv named "results.csv" will be created in your working directory.
